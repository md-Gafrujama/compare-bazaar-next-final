      <p className="text-base text-gray-800 mb-4">
        Email marketing is a digital strategy that involves sending targeted messages to prospects 
        and customers through email. It allows businesses to communicate directly with their audience, 
        nurturing leads and fostering loyalty.
      </p>
      <p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Unlike other marketing channels, email provides a direct line of communication that you own, 
        independent of algorithm changes or platform restrictions. With an average ROI of $36 for every 
        $1 spent, email marketing remains one of the most effective marketing strategies available.
      </p>
      <p className="text-base text-gray-700">
        Modern email marketing goes far beyond simple newsletters. Today's sophisticated campaigns 
        leverage personalization, automation, and data-driven insights to deliver the right message 
        to the right person at the right time.

            <p className="mb-4 text-base">  This great return is thanks to email’s direct approach. You’re connecting with people who already like your brand, so they’re more likely to trust you and make a purchase.</p>
