  const gpsFleetFAQs = [
    {
      question: "How does GPS fleet tracking improve my operations?",
      answer: [
        "Real-time vehicle location monitoring",
        "Optimized route planning to reduce fuel costs",
        "Improved dispatch efficiency",
        "Reduced unauthorized vehicle use",
        "Better customer ETAs with live tracking"
      ]
    },
    {
      question: "What types of vehicles can use GPS tracking?",
      answer: "Our GPS tracking solutions work with all types of fleet vehicles including trucks, vans, cars, construction equipment, and even trailers. The system is compatible with most modern vehicles regardless of make or model."
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate is the GPS tracking?",
      answer: "Our systems provide location accuracy within 5-10 meters using advanced GPS technology with GLONASS support. In urban areas with tall buildings, the system automatically switches to cellular tower triangulation for continuous tracking."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I monitor driver behavior with GPS tracking?",
      answer: [
        "Yes, our system tracks and reports on:",
        "Speeding incidents",
        "Harsh braking and acceleration",
        "Excessive idling time",
        "Seat belt usage (with optional sensors)",
        "Provides driver safety scorecards"
      ]
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if a vehicle loses cellular connection?",
      answer: "The tracking device stores all data locally when outside coverage areas and automatically transmits it when connection is restored. Critical alerts are queued and sent immediately when service returns."
    },
    {
      question: "How often is the vehicle location updated?",
      answer: "Location updates occur every 30 seconds by default, but can be adjusted to as frequent as every 10 seconds for high-priority vehicles. During periods of inactivity, updates may be less frequent to conserve battery."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I set up custom alerts and notifications?",
      answer: [
        "Yes, you can configure alerts for:",
        "Geofence entry/exit",
        "Speeding violations",
        "After-hours vehicle use",
        "Maintenance reminders",
        "Harsh driving events",
        "Low battery warnings"
      ]
    },
    {
      question: "Is the GPS tracking system difficult to install?",
      answer: "Our plug-and-play devices can be self-installed in minutes with no wiring required for most vehicles. For complex installations or heavy equipment, we offer professional installation services."

             Introduction to GPS Fleet Management
            </h1>
            <p className="text-base text-gray-800 mb-8 text-justify">
            Managing your fleet with GPS isn't just about tracking dots on a map—it's about breathing new life into your business operations.
Picture this: your drivers navigating confidently while you peek at their progress from your desk. No more frantic phone calls asking "Where are you?" or customers left wondering when service will arrive.
Every vehicle tells its own story—from the delivery van that found a shortcut saving 20 minutes daily, to the truck whose gentle acceleration extended its engine life by years. These aren't just data points; they're opportunities hiding in plain sight.
Your fuel bills dropping? That's what happens when drivers stop taking the scenic route home. Maintenance costs stabilizing? Thank the system that caught that oil leak before it became a roadside breakdown.
Beyond the numbers, it's about peace of mind. Setting up virtual boundaries around job sites or seeing who's available for that urgent call-out gives you control without micromanaging.
For businesses with wheels on the ground, smart GPS management isn't a luxury—it's the difference between surviving and thriving in a world where every minute and mile counts.  </p>

              Tiny devices in each truck constantly talk with satellites circling high above Earth. By measuring distance from at least three satellites simultaneously, they pinpoint exactly where your vehicles are—within a few feet. The same technology guiding your weekend hikes now keeps your business moving efficiently every day.   </p>

              "Modern trackers show more than just where trucks are," explains Mark. "They reveal engine health and driving habits too."

Today's fleet systems transform vehicle data into clear insights on manager dashboards. Companies set digital boundaries around locations, plan smarter routes, schedule maintenance before breakdowns, and maintain compliance records—all in one system.

It's evolved from simple tracking to a complete management tool that works around the clock, catching issues before they become problems.

              These systems do more than just track vehicles—they give you full control over your fleet. With features like geofencing, route planning, maintenance reminders, and compliance tracking, you can streamline operations and stay on top of regulations. By combining reliable hardware with smart software, you get a powerful solution that helps optimize your fleet’s performance. </p>
